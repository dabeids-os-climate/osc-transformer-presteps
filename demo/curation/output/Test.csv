In which year was the annual report or the sustainability report published?,"This report shows much progress. But Shell must further step up efforts on all fronts, from climate change to ethical leadership to greater transparency. We must continue to make a real contribution to people’s lives. We can only do this by keeping our approach to sustainability at the heart of the way we do business.",0,2019,test_annotations.xlsx,Royal Dutch Shell plc,2019,Test.pdf,['0'],0,TEXT,1
What is the total amount of direct greenhouse gases emissions referred to as scope 1 emissions?,"Greenhouse gas emissions performance Our direct GHG emissions decreased from 71 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2018 to 70 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2019. The main reasons for the decrease were divestments (for example, in Argentina, Canada, Iraq, Malaysia, Norway and the UK). These decreases were partly offset by the start-up of the Prelude floating liquefied natural gas facility in Australia.",1,70 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent,test_annotations.xlsx,Royal Dutch Shell plc,2019,Test.pdf,['2'],1,TEXT,6

What is the total amount of energy indirect greenhouse gases emissions referred to as scope 2 emissions?,"Contributing to society also means gaining and maintaining people’s trust. We do this by being as open as we can about what we do and why we do it. For example, we are being increasingly transparent about the industry groups we are part of. In 2019, we published the Industry Associations Climate Review, which assessed for the first time Shell’s alignment with 19 industry associations on climate-related policy. We also published our first Tax Contribution Report in 2019, which presents Shell’s approach to tax and explains how our business activities are taxed globally.",0,"71 million tonnes of CO2

What is the base year for carbon reduction commitment?,"We continue to work towards delivering on our Net Carbon Footprint ambition to cut the intensity of the greenhouse gas emissions of the energy products we sell by about 50% by 2050, and 20% by 2035 compared to our 2016 levels, in step with society as it moves towards meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement. In 2019, we set shorter-term targets for 2021 of 2-3% lower than our 2016 baseline Net Carbon Footprint. In early 2020, we set a Net Carbon Footprint target for 2022 of 3-4% lower than our 2016 baseline. We will continue to evolve our approach over time.",1,2016,test_annotations.xlsx,Royal Dutch Shell plc,2019,Test.pdf,['1'],3,TEXT,9
